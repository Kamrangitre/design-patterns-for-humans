Mark Richards and Neal Ford—hands-on practitioners who have taught software architecture classes professionally for years—focus on architecture principles that apply across all technology stacks. You’ll explore software architecture in a modern light, taking into account all the innovations of the past decade.

This book examines:

* Architecture patterns: The technical basis for many architectural decisions
* Components: Identification, coupling, cohesion, partitioning, and granularity
* Soft skills: Effective team management, meetings, negotiation, presentations, and more
* Modernity: Engineering practices and operational approaches that have changed radically in the past few years
* Architecture as an engineering discipline: Repeatable results, metrics, and concrete valuations that add rigor to software architecture.
