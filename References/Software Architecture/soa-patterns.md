SOA Patterns provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others, using plain language. You'll understand the design patterns that promote and enforce flexibility, availability, and scalability. Each of the 26 patterns uses the classic problem/solution format and a unique technology map to show where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.
Written for working developers and architects building services and service-oriented solutions. Knowledge of Java or C# is helpful but not required.
