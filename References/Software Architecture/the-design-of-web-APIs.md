Web APIs are everywhere, giving developers an efficient way to interact with applications, services, and data. Well-designed APIs are a joy to use; poorly-designed APIs are cumbersome, confusing, and frustrating.

The Design of Web APIs is a practical, example packed guide to crafting extraordinary web APIs. Author Arnaud Lauret demonstrates fantastic design principles and techniques you can apply to both public and private web APIs.
