Software Engineering Concepts

# Intro
In this repository, we talk about the `Software Engineering Concepts` and try to create amazing applications to make the world a better place!

> so, in this journey, we can help each other ;) let's go...

# SOLID Principles

* Wikipedia
> In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by American software engineer and instructor Robert C. Martin, first introduced in his 2000 paper Design Principles and Design Patterns.


### List of the principles
* [S – SRP – Single-responsiblity principle]() 
* [O – OCP (Open-closed principle)]()
* [L – LSP (Liskov substitution principle)]()
* [I – ISP (Interface segregation principle)]()
* [D – DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)]()

# Design Patterns

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; **guidelines on how to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations. [Read more...](Design-Patterns/README.md#introduction)

**Wikipedia** 
> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
